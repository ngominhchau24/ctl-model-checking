# Equation 10 Verification Results

## Equation:
 [[AG P]] = νZ.([[P]] ∩ τAX(Z)) where P = p1n:

    This equation defines the semantics of the always globally operator using a greatest fixpoint.     νZ.f(Z) denotes the greatest fixpoint of the operation f(Z). 

## Results:

| P | Q | Computed | Manually Computed | Holds |
|:---|:---|:---------|:-----------------|:------|
| p1n |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
| p1t |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
| p1c |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
| p2n |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
| p2t |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
| p2c |  | `{}` | `{}` | YES |
